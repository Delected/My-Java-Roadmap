# My-Java-Roadmap
My personal path of learning for all things Java. Feel free to use this too!

the roadmap is in the pdf file attached (lossless zooming).

all opinions on the roadmap are my own, if you disagree, please remember that this is not a definitive guide to all technologies people should or should not be learning.

**I will be providing resources to learn soon!**

### CHANGES
- gRPC is another popular web client people like to use now-a-days. It might be of best interest to learn this. This is the most commonly used implementation of RPC today. Most other RPC technologies are--in my opinion--out of date.

### DATABASES
- Learn MySQL (currently the most popular database)
- Learn PostgreSQL (the most "modern" sql database, used a lot in web apps)
- Learn MongoDB (frequently used in web apps, very fast unstructured data in JSON format)
- I would also recommend learning a little bit about H2 (embedded Java database) and Redis (in-memory storage which can be persisted)

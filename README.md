# My-Java-Roadmap
My personal path of learning for all things Java. Feel free to use this too!

the roadmap is in the pdf file attached (loseless zooming).

all opinions on the roadmap are my own, if you disagree, please remember that this is not a definitive guide to all technologies people should or should not be learning.

**I will be providing resources to learn soon!**

# My-Java-Roadmap
My personal path of learning for all things Java. Feel free to use this too!

the roadmap is in the pdf file attached (loseless zooming).

all opinions on the roadmap are my own, if you disagree, please remember that this is not a definitive guide to all technologies people should or should not be learning.

**I will be providing resources to learn soon!**

### DATABASES
- Learn MySQL (currently the most popular database)
- Learn PostgreSQL (the most "modern" sql database, used a lot in web apps)
- Learn MongoDB (frequently used in web apps, very fast unstructured data in JSON format)
- I would also recommend learning a little bit about H2 (embedded Java database) and Redis (in-memory storage which can be persisted)
